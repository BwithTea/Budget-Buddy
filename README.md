Hello all! This project is a simple command line budget management program. I can get really mixed up when it comes to finances, so I wanted to start
creating a program that helps me manage them. This program currently has a basic user log in system and menu options to open a bill and when the bill 
is open options to modify the bill that is open. Eventaully I want to add delete, create options that add another layer of functionality. As well as 
various data manipulation techinques to return different calculations that the user requests. I think this program will continue to be a joy to make
because financial maturity is very important to me and this program will actually serve a purpose in my personal life to make finances easier to manage.
